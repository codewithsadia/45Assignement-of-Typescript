//23. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
//describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
//should look something like this:

//let car = 'subaru';

//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

//console.log(car == 'subaru')

//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

let five = 5 ;
let ten = 10 ;

//Test 1
console.log("Test 1: five is equal to 5?");
console.log(five==5);

//Test 2
console.log("Test 2: ten is equals to 10?");
console.log(ten==10);

//Test 3
console.log("\n Test 3: 5 is not Equal to 10?");
console.log(five!=10);

//Test 4
console.log("\n Test 4: 10 is greater than 5?");
console.log(ten > 5);

//Test 5
console.log("\n Test 5: 5 is smaller than 10?");
console.log(five < 10);

//Test 6
console.log("\n Test 6: 10 is smaller than 5");
console.log(ten < 5);

//Test 7
console.log("\n Test 7: 5 is equal to 10");
console.log(five==10);

//Test 8
console.log("\n Test 8: 10 is not equal to 10");
console.log(10 != 10);

//Test 9
console.log("\n Test 9: 5 is greater than 10");
console.log(5 > 10);

// Test 10
console.log("\n Test 10: 100 is smaller than 50");
console.log(100 < 50);
