//16.More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
//• Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.

//• Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

//• Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.


//creating a guestlist Array
let guestList=["Hania","Saad","Umaima","Imran"];

//Making variable for those guest who cant come 
let dontcome=guestList[0];

//print the name of guest who cant come
console.log(dontcome,"Nahi Ahh sakte ha");

//Add or Remove values from guest list Array
guestList.splice(0,1,"Hania");

//Message print for bigger table
console.log("Good News! we have found a bigger table for dinner.");

//Adding a new guest of starting index of Array
guestList.unshift("Ali");

//Adding a new guest at ending index of Array
guestList.push("Zain");

//Get a middle index of our guest list arrray
let middleindex: number = Math.floor (guestList.length / 2 );

//Adding a new guest to middle index of array
guestList.splice(middleindex,0,"osama");

//print message of updated list 
console.log("updated list of our guests");

//sending a invitation message to our guest one by one with ther names
guestList.forEach(oneguest => console.log(`salam ${oneguest}, would you like to dinner with me `));
