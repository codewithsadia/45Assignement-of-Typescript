//40. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object
//describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
//album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of
//information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
//albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the
//album information correctly.
//Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
//number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number
//of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new
//function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
//Difine the make_album function
function make_album(artist_name, album_title, tracks) {
    let album = {
        artist: artist_name,
        title: album_title,
    };
    if (tracks !== undefined) {
        album.tracks = tracks;
    }
    return album;
}
//Calling three and creating 3 variables function with different values
let album1 = make_album("Sadia", "Artist No . 1");
let album2 = make_album("Hania", "Artist No . 2");
//Calling a make_album funcyion with third parameter
let album3 = make_album("Saad", "Artist No . 3", 10);
//Print values of our object created my function
console.log(album1);
console.log(album2);
console.log(album3);
export {};
